    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025</p>

    <h3>1. Acceptance</h3>
    <p class="muted">By using Noctis Supply (the "Service") you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the Service or purchase from us.</p>

    <h3>2. Our Role</h3>
    <p class="muted">Noctis Supply acts as a platform and facilitator connecting buyers with verified vendors and products. For digital vendor links we use third-party delivery systems (e.g., MyAuth). For physical products we use third-party storefronts (e.g., Shopify) and partnered suppliers. We verify partners but do not directly manufacture or own vendor inventories.</p>

    <h3>3. Orders & Payments</h3>
    <p class="muted">All payments are processed by third-party payment processors. We do not store full payment credentials. Refunds and chargebacks are subject to the payment provider’s policies and the vendor’s return policy. We will assist with disputes and verification where possible.</p>

    <h3>4. Shipping & Customs</h3>
    <p class="muted">Delivery times vary by supplier and shipping choice. International orders may be subject to customs duties and taxes, which are the buyer’s responsibility unless otherwise agreed. We are not liable for customs delays, fees, or seized shipments when applicable by law.</p>

    <h3>5. VIP Membership</h3>
    <p class="muted">VIP is a paid, manually approved privilege. VIP benefits are described on the VIP page. VIP memberships are non-transferable. We reserve the right to revoke VIP access for abuse or violations of these Terms.</p>

    <h3>6. Intellectual Property</h3>
    <p class="muted">All content on our site is owned or licensed by Noctis Supply. You may not reproduce, republish or otherwise exploit our content without written permission.</p>

    <h3>7. Liability</h3>
    <p class="muted">To the fullest extent permitted by law, Noctis Supply’s liability for any claim related to the Service is limited to direct damages up to the amount paid for the relevant order. We are not responsible for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including lost profits.</p>

    <h3>8. Prohibited Use</h3>
    <p class="muted">You may not use our services for illegal purposes, fraud, or to infringe the rights of others. Abusive behavior or scams will result in account and community bans.</p>

    <h3>9. Changes</h3>
    <p class="muted">We may modify these Terms at any time. Updates will be posted here and continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h3>10. Governing Law</h3>
    <p class="muted">These Terms are governed by the laws applicable to the operation location of Noctis Supply (Germany). Disputes will be handled in the competent jurisdiction unless otherwise required.</p>
