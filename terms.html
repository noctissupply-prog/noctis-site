  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 2025</p>

  <h3>1. Acceptance</h3>
  <p>By using Noctis Supply you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use our services.</p>

  <h3>2. Role</h3>
  <p>Noctis Supply acts as a facilitator between buyers and verified vendors (digital via MyAuth) and physical products (via Shopify). We verify partners but do not manufacture products.</p>

  <h3>3. Payments & Refunds</h3>
  <p>Payments are processed by third parties. For refunds follow the provider rules and open a ticket in Discord; we assist with mediation.</p>

  <h3>4. Liability</h3>
  <p>Noctis Supply is not liable for vendor-side delays, customs, or third-party policies beyond our verification checks.</p>
