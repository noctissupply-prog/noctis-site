  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 2025</p>

  <h3>1. Acceptance</h3>
  <p>By using Noctis Supply you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the site.</p>

  <h3>2. Our Role</h3>
  <p>Noctis Supply acts as a facilitator connecting customers with digital vendor links (via MyAuth) and physical products (via Shopify). We verify partners and provide quality checks but we do not directly manufacture or guarantee vendor inventory beyond our checks.</p>

  <h3>3. Orders & Payments</h3>
  <p>All payments are processed by third-party payment processors. Refunds and chargebacks follow the third party’s policies (Shopify or MyAuth). We review claims and will help mediate disputes but are not the payment processor.</p>

  <h3>4. Liability</h3>
  <p>Noctis Supply is not liable for vendor-side shipment delays, customs issues, or vendor returns beyond our verification checks. For physical product disputes, follow our returns policy and open a ticket in Discord.</p>

  <h3>5. Prohibited Use</h3>
  <p>You may not use the site for illegal activity, scams, or to post abusive content. Violation may result in removal from our community and bans.</p>

  <h3>6. Changes</h3>
  <p>We may update these terms. Continued use indicates acceptance of changes.</p>

  <h3>7. Contact</h3>
