  <h1>Returns & Refunds</h1>
  <p>We aim to keep our customers satisfied. Because we work with third-party vendors and often resell limited items, returns and refunds depend on the product type.</p>

  <h3>Physical products (Shopify)</h3>
  <p>If you bought a physical product via our Shopify store, open a ticket in Discord or email <a href="mailto:arestrot@noctissupply.online">arestrot@noctissupply.online</a> within 7 days with order ID and photos. We will advise on return eligibility and shipping instructions.</p>

  <h3>Digital / Vendor Links (MyAuth)</h3>
  <p>Digital purchases and vendor links are non-refundable unless proven faulty (wrong link, broken delivery). Submit evidence and we will review within 48 hours.</p>
